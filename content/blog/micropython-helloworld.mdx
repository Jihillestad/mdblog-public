# Introduction

This is some simple examples programming your micro:bit using **micro:bit Python**. We will
keep it at a beginner level this time. The goal is for you to connect to your **micro:bit**
and get started.

# Let's get started

First of all, it is time to connect your **micro:bit** to your computer. Use the provide
USB to microUSB cable to connect your **micro:bit** to your computer. The factory example
will start playing, and you can interact with it if you like to. When you are ready to
start programming it with your own stuff, follow this guide.

## Set up the Project Environment

Let's set up the Project Environment so you can start writing code and flash it to your
**micro:bit**. If you are doing this together with your kids, I recommend using the web-based
[micro:bit Python](https://python.microbit.org/v/3) editor. If you have some Dev experience,
follow along with the VsCode chapter. There are some really cool extensions which get the job done.
For true ninjas, do the first steps to initialize the Project Environment in VsCode. Then move on to
the **Neovim** chapter.

### Web-based micro:bit Python editor

1. Open the [micro:bit Python](https://python.microbit.org/v/3) website.
2. Make sure your **micro:bit** is connected with the provided cable.
3. When you open the web editor, there is an example code for writing "Hello" and displaying a heart
   on the LEDs of your **micro:bit**.
4. Click "Save". Select or create a folder on your computer to contain the Project Environment.
5. Let&apos;s connect the Project Environment to the **micro:bit**:

   1. In the bottom left corner, click on the **3 vertical dots**.
      <Image
        alt="Microbit"
        src="/Sendtomicrobit001.png"
        width={250}
        height={250}
      />
   2. Click **Next**.

      <Image
        alt="Microbit"
        src="/Sendtomicrobit002.png"
        width={400}
        height={400}
      />

   3. Click **Next**.

      <Image
        alt="Microbit"
        src="/Sendtomicrobit003.png"
        width={400}
        height={400}
      />

   4. Mark the detected **micro:bit** and click **Connect**

      <Image
        alt="Microbit"
        src="/Sendtomicrobit004.png"
        width={400}
        height={400}
      />

   5. If the connection is successful, you should see the following line under your code:

      <Image
        alt="Microbit"
        src="/Sendtomicrobit006.png"
        width={250}
        height={250}
      />

After following these steps, you are ready to start coding your **micro:bit** using **micro:bit Python Web Editor**.
You can test using the **virtual micro:bit** on the website or try to send the code to your micro:bit later in
this post.

### Using VsCode

If you have some Dev experience and want to set up your Project Environment like you do on your job, you can
use a proper IDE like VsCode with some extensions enabling Intellisense and sending your code to your micro:bit.

#### Extensions.

First of all, you need an extension for **micro:bit Python**:

1. Open **VsCode**.
2. Go to **Extensions** and search for **micro:bit Python by MAKInterakt**. Select **Install**.
3. Restart VsCode

#### Initialize

1. In **VsCode**, Select "Open". Create a new folder for your Project Environment, f.ex "HelloWorld"
2. Once inside the folder, press "Shift-Cmd-p" to open the **Command Menu**. Search for
   **micro:bit-python: Flash MicroPython environment on micro:bit** and press **Enter**. This will install
   the necessary firmware to run **micro:bit Python** on your **micro:bit**.
3. Run **micro:bit-python: Initialize the workspace**. This will add the folder "./microbit" to your
   Project Environment, enabling **Intellisense** code auto completion.

You are now ready to write code in **VsCode**

### Using NeoVim and Terminal

If you truly are a Terminal lover and Keyboard Ninja, it is definitely possible to use Neovim to write
**micro:bit Python**. This is recommended for Devs who are used to writing Python code in Neovim, and
have the necessary LSP&apos;s, Linters and Formatters in place. You need to install the **uflash**
module for Python, requiring a Python Virtual Environment to follow best-practices.

#### Initialize the Python Virtual Environment

1. Run the **Initialize** steps for **VsCode** in the chapter above. In your next project, get you only need
   to copy the ./microbit folder from a previous Project Environment to your new one.
2. Run the following **bash** / **zsh** lines to set up the Python Virtual Environment:

sudo python3 -m venv .
source ./bin/activate

3. Run the following **bash** / **zsh** line to install **uflash**:

sudo pip install uflash

You can now start coding. Just create the python file using `touch main.py` and then `nvim main.py`

## Writing code

Let&apos;s write some code and have a bit of fun!

### Display some text on the micro:bit LEDs

In this example, let us make the **micro:bit** greet us.

```python
from microbit import *

display.scroll("Booyakasha!")

```

### Deploy using the Web Editor

The Web Editor is the easiest way to deploy code to your **micro:bit** when no IDE is installed. Simply
click the **Send to micro:bit** button when done.

<Image alt="Microbit" src="/Sendtomicrobit001.png" width={250} height={250} />

### Deploy using VsCode

You can use the **micro:bit Python by MAKInterakt** extension to deploy code to your **micro:bit**:

1. Save your code, make sure to name it **main.py**.
2. Press **shift-cmd-p** to search for command. Select **micro:bit-python: Flash sketch on the micro:bit**.
   and press **Enter** to run.

### Deploy using Neovim and Terminal

The **uflash** utility can deploy **python** files to the **micro:bit** using the **Terminal** interface:

1. In **neovim**, press **:w** to save the **python file**.
2. In **Terminal**, run the command `uflash filename.py`

## More code

In the last example, a message is displayed on the **micro:bit** LEDs once. Now, let&apos;s make
sure the message repeats as long as the **miro:bit** is powered using an **Infinite loop**.

```python
from microbit import *

while true:
    display.scroll("Booyakasha!")
```

## Summary

This was an introduction to programming the **micro:bit** using **micro:bit python**. There are
many ways of doing it, I have covered some of them. There are other tools as well, whatever
floats your boat. Have fun playing around with your **micro:bit**, I hope this post can help
you get started.
