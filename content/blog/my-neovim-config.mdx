## Introduction

This setup will help you get going with Neovim, with a lot of useful plugins and LSP's that
makes coding and text editing efficient and a lot of fun. I highly recommend watching this
Youtube content from [Josean Martinez](https://www.youtube.com/@joseanmartinez) before continuing.
I got started using his setup, and added my own stuff on top op that.

## Get my setup

1. First, get my public dotfiles repo:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/repos/github.com/yourname/
   cd ~/repos/github.com/yourname/
   git clone https://github.com/Jihillestad/dotfiles-public.git
   cd ~/repos/github.com/yourname/dotfiles-public
   rm -rf ./.git
   ```

2. Install Neovim. I am a MacOS user, so I'll use **homebrew**:

   ```bash
   brew install neovim
   brew install neovim-remote
   brew install ripgrep
   brew install fzf
   brew install wget
   brew install node
   brew install treesitter
   brew install python
   ```

3. Install MacTeX - A LaTeX compiler for MacOS

   ```bash
   brew install mactex
   ```

4. Install and configure Skim, a pdf reader that integrates well with neovim and LaTeX compilers:

   1. Download and install Skim from here: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/skim-app/files/Skim/Skim-1.7.4/Skim-1.7.4.dmg/download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/skim-app/files/Skim/Skim-1.7.4/Skim-1.7.4.dmg/download)
   2. Go to Skim -> Settings - Sync
   3. Under PDF-TeX Sync Support -> Preset: Custom
   4. Under PDF-TeX Sync Support -> Command: nvim
   5. Under PDF-TeX Sync Support -> Arguments: --headless -c "VimtexInverseSearch %line '%file'"
      <Image alt="Skim" src="/skim002.png" width={400} height={400} />

5. Make your own local git repo

   ```bash
   git init
   git add -A
   git commit -m "initial commit"
   ```

6. Symlink the neovim config:

   ```bash
   ln -s ~/repos/github.com/yourname/dotfiles-public/nvim ~/.config/nvim
   ```

7. Start Neovim using this command:

   ```bash
   nvim
   ```

8. You might have to restart Neovim a few times for **Lazy.nvim** to finish installing everything and their
   dependencies.

## Summary

This will get you started. I cannot guarantee that it works on your system. Keymaps could make some issues,
these you have to figure out. Happy learning!
