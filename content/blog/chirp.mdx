# Introduction

This is an exercise where we can learn some **Python** while having a bit of fun. We will start making
an animated "bird" and make it chirp using the **Display** and **Audio** features of the **micro:bit**.

## Set up the project

For this exercise, we will use [micro:bit Python Web Editor](https://python.microbit.org/v/3). Bring your kids along, code snippets can
be dragged and dropped for quick code writing and easy understanding as we move along.

1. Connect your **micro:bit** to your computer using the microUSB cable.
2. Connect the [micro:bit Python Web Editor](https://python.microbit.org/v/3) to your **micro:bit**.
3. Send the Default Sample Code to your **micro:bit** to make sure it works.

4. If everything works, your **micro:bit** should show a **heart** on the display, followed by
   **scrolling text "Hello"**.
5. Have you noticed the **micro:bit simulation** in the upper right corner of the Web Editor? This
   is very useful.

## Our quiet pet

Let's start making our pet bird animation.

1. In the **left pane**, there are samples that can be dragged and dropped to the **code window**. Expand the
   **Display** container.
   <Image alt="Microbit" src="/chirp004.png" width={400} height={400} />
2. Grab the highlighted `display.show(Image(...))` snippet. Then drag and drop it 2 times. Delete the code
   that displays a heart and scroll message. The code should look like the picture below, needing some changes.
   <Image alt="Microbit" src="/chirp005.png" width={400} height={400} />
3. Let's start making our pet. We make a **matrix** determining the light strength for each **LED** on the
   **micro:bit display** from 0 to 9.
   <Image alt="Microbit" src="/chirp006.png" width={400} height={800} />
4. The animation is probably way too fast! Let's slow it down a bit, shall we? Adding a pause after each picture
   using `sleep(400)` should to the trick.

Now we have created a hungry pet bird opening and closing it's beak and blinking it's eyes. Use the simulation, or
send the code to your **micro:bit** for testing.

Our bird is still quiet. In the next part of the exercise, we'll give it some voice.

## Time to chirp!!!

To complete this challenge, we only need one line of code for our bird to chirp. To make it easy for beginners or
our kids to follow along, we'll drag and drop the snippet we need.

1. In the **left pane**, expand the **Sound** container.
   <Image alt="Microbit" src="/chirp008.png" width={400} height={400} />
2. Drag and drop `audio.play(Sound.GIGGLE)` to the bottom of the code inside the **while** loop.
   <Image alt="Microbit" src="/chirp009.png" width={800} height={800} />
3. The finished code should look like this:
   <Image alt="Microbit" src="/chirp010.png" width={800} height={800} />
4. Test using the **simulation** or sending the code to your **micro:bit**

## The complete micro:bit python code

```python
# Imports go at the top
from microbit import *


# Code in a 'while True:' loop repeats forever
while True:

    display.show(Image('00000:'
                       '06060:'
                       '00000:'
                       '09990:'
                       '00000'))
    sleep(400)

    display.show(Image('00000:'
                       '09090:'
                       '00900:'
                       '09090:'
                       '00900'))

    audio.play(Sound.GIGGLE)
```
