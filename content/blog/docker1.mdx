# Introduction

I’ve recently had the chance to explore **Docker** more, and it’s truly
amazing! Containerizing your environments offers a lot of benefits. It’s
essential to learn this if you’re getting started in **DevOps**.

> "It works on my system!"

With **Docker**, containerizing environments makes them portable. You can
define prerequisites and their versions while configuring the containers,
ensuring they behave the same on different computers or servers.

This is basic stuff. There are hundreds of posts like this online, so feel free
to move on to more interesting topics. However, it’s here if needed as context
for more advanced content to come.

# The Basics

On **Docker Hub**, there are tons of useful container images to help you get
started containerizing your projects. Let’s run our first container:

```bash
docker run -d nginx
```

This command pulls the nginx image from Docker Hub (if it’s not already on your
system) and then starts a container running that image.

Let’s test it:

<Image alt="Docker1002" src="/docker1002.png" width={800} height={800} />

## What went wrong?

```bash
docker ps
```

<Image alt="Docker1003" src="/docker1003.png" width={800} height={800} />

As you can see, the container is running. Under PORTS, you’ll notice that the
container is running on 80/tcp internally, but we forgot to expose it on a
specific port. Let’s fix this.

## Some Docker networking

We'll recreate the container and then make it accessible outside the container with these
commands:

```bash
docker stop nostalgic_torvalds
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

<Image alt="Docker1004" src="/docker1004.png" width={800} height={800} />

Now, we can access our nginx container in the browser. Let’s verify our running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

<Image alt="Docker1005" src="/docker1005.png" width={800} height={800} />

To stop all running containers, use this command:

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
```

# Docker files

When creating your own containers, using the docker run command can become
lengthy and difficult to manage in the shell. Often, you’ll need to create your
own images tailored to your application’s needs.

## Dockerfile

The Dockerfile is used to build Docker images. Here’s an example that builds an
Apache server running on Ubuntu:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update && \
  apt-get install -y apache2 apache2-utils && \
  apt-get clean

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
```

## docker-compose

The docker-compose.yaml file is a YAML file for creating and running
containers. Running `docker compose up` will start the container with the
configured settings from docker-compose.yaml. Without any -f (file) parameters,
the command looks for a Dockerfile in the current directory to build the image
before running the container.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    restart: always
```

## .dockerignore

If you are copying files in your Dockerfile, creating a .dockerignore file
allows you to ignore certain files or folders, similar to how .gitignore works.
