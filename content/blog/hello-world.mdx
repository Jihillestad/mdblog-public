## How it all started

I have worked with ops and consultancies for more than 19 years. My breadwinning skills
are EUC and Deployment, as well as a broad knowledge in Microsoft tech. I learned a lot
of valuable skills from experience as well as fellow tech bloggers and youtubers.

## Time to learn something different

4 years ago, I decided to make the first big change in my work platform. Exit Windows, enter MacOS!
A whole new world was there before me. After getting through the steepest part of the learning curve,
I installed **Homebrew** on my Mac. A whole new galaxy of Open Source tools and productivity boosters
was in my hands!

## Exploring the Dark Side of the Force

After many years of Ops, working with automation made me more curious about Dev and DevOps. I look
forward to learning more and share with my fellow geeks.
