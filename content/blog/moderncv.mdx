## Introduction

<Image alt="Layoff" src="/layoff001.png" width={400} height={400} />

Laid off again. The harsh truth of the IT Industry. What do i do now???

Many of us have been there. I god laid off from a small company last week because of hard times
in my country. I have been laid off before, this motivates me to share with you.

## What do do?

You have just been hit hard emotionally. The job you love is gone. Your social circle is shrinking. You
have financial worries. This situation sucks...

But it is also a great opportunity! Keep following along, and I'll share how to move ahead.

First of all, get some fresh air and clear your mind. Spend some time with your friends and your loved
ones. This can help you get some emotional support and good advice before moving on to the next step.

Now it's time to start working on your way out of this mess. The main **two things** you have to to is
to **apply for jobs** and **learn new stuff**. We are going to **combine these two** to make it more
interesting.

## Applying for jobs while learning something new

To make applying for jobs quicker and more interesting, I decided to learn new stuff while applying for jobs.
I love working in the **terminal** to focus on the text rather than spending too much time on disturbances
like formatting.

### Something old, something new

#### LaTeX

To handle formatting, i use **LaTeX** together with the package **moderncv**. This package is included in most
**LaTeX** bundles like MacTex or MikTex. **LaTeX** started out as **TeX** in 1978, written by Donald
Knuth. Since then it has received many new features, and it is a big community around it. It is a
typography tool, not a text editor.

#### Moderncv

The Moderncv package has helped me write good looking CV's and Cover Letters opening many doors for me.
To avoid TLDR, i'll point you to other locations for more knowledge about **moderncv**:
[https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv?lang=en](https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv?lang=en)
[https://github.com/moderncv](https://github.com/moderncv)

#### Shell scripting

I learned some shell scripting to make writing Cover Letters a low quicker and easier.

## Let's set it all up

1. First, make sure you have a **LaTeX compiler** and **Neovim with vimtex** installed. My previous blog post
   [https://www.jannidar.com/blog/my-neovim-config](https://www.jannidar.com/blog/my-neovim-config) provides
   just that.

2. Clone my **moderncv-public** repo:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   mkdir -p ~/projects/latex
   cd ~/projects/latex/
   git clone https://github.com/Jihillestad/modencv-public
   ```

3. Add this to your **.zshrc** or **.bashrc** files:

   ```bash
   export MODERNCV="$HOME/projects/latex/moderncv-public"
   ```

4. Make sure to source **.zshrc** or **.bashrc** after saving.

5. Make the shell script **mkcl** executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/projects/latex/moderncv-public/mkcl
   ```

## Now, to Business

The tools are set up, now lets set the wheels in motion. I have provided a template to make this
easier for you:

**cv.tex**

### Write your CV

This makes a good looking CV. Replace my placeholders with your stuff, and make sure to keep your
CV concise.

### Compile your CV

1. Editing **cv.tex** in **Neovim** should automatically load the **vimtex** plugin if using my setup.
   To compile continuously, press `\ll`. In my setup, **localleader** is set to "\\". Using my setup will
   also load the pdf reader **Skim** automatically when compiling. When saving the **cv.tex** file while running
   continuous compiling, the PDF file in **Skim** will update as well.
2. When happy with the result, stop the compiler using the same keys as starting compiling: `\ll`

3. Create a subfolder named ~/projects/latex/moderncv-public/pub and copy the pdf file using the following command:

   ```bash
   cp ~/projects/latex/moderncv-public/*.pdf ~/projects/latex/moderncv-public/pub/
   ```

4. In **Neovim**, use the following keys to clean up all temporary LaTeX compiler files using: `\lC`

### Write and compile your Cover Letter

After studying the Job Ad meticulously, it's time to make the Cover Letter to stand out from the crowd. AI can help
get you going, especially when it comes to scoping the Cover Letter as compliant as possible to the Job Ad. Use your
own words in the final Cover Letter, and make sure you can back up every written word in order to succeed.

1. Run the shell script `~/projects/latex/moderncv-public/mkcl`

2. Fill in the employer name and press Enter. In this example, lets call it ACME

3. **Neovim** now opens 2 files in 2 separate panes. One file contains the **structure of the document: cl-ACME.tex**, while the other
   file should contain the **Cover Letter text only: cl-ACME-content.tex**.
4. In **cl-ACME.tex**, make sure to substitute the following:
   1. \[Recruiter\] with the **name of the recruiter in the Job Ad**.
   2. Address
   3. Zipcode
   4. City
5. Save **cl-ACME.tex**
6. Write your Cover Letter in **cl-ACME-content.tex** and save the file and save the file.
7. In **cl-ACME.tex**, start compiling using `\ll`. Verify that the pdf file looks good in **Skim**.
8. When satisfied with the Cover letter, stop the compiler using `\ll`. Copy the pdf to ./pub using:

   ```bash
   cp ~/projects/latex/moderncv-public/*.pdf ~/projects/latex/moderncv-public/pub/
   ```

9. In **Neovim: cl-ACME.tex**, use the following keys to clean up all temporary LaTeX compiler files using: `\lC`

10. Archive the application files using:

```bash
mv ~/projects/latex/moderncv-public/cl-*.tex ~/projects/latex/moderncv-public/archive/
```

11. To easily find the pdf files for the application, you can use a **symlink** to put the files in a folder named
    **jobseek** on your Desktop:

```bash
ln -s ~/projects/latex/moderncv-public/pub ~/Desktop/jobseek
```

## Good luck!

I wish you good luck finding your dream job and get out of the mess a layoff is. I understand this is a bit heavy the
first time setting this up. I save a lot of time applying for jobs doing this, as well as being able to
**completely focus on the text in the Cover Letter**. If you like to learn more or improve stuff, your are free to
**fork my repo** and work on it.
